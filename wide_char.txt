A wide character (or in short, a wide char) is a character datatype that has a larger size than 1 byte.
Usually, wide characters are used to represent characters which require more memory than regular characters
from the ASCII table.

Wide characters are indeed affected by endianness, because the bytes that form the wide char are treated as one
unit. Therefore, reversing the byte order of each unit will in fact change its content.

A well-known encoding that uses wide characters is Unicode! Unicode uses 2 bytes to represent its characters,
and therefore it uses wide chars.
